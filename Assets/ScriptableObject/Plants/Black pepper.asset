  <Name>k__BackingField: Black pepper
  <Description>k__BackingField: '<b>Piper nigrum L.</b>, commonly known as black
    pepper, is a flowering vine that produces small, round fruits called peppercorns,
    which are green when unripe and turn red when fully mature. These peppercorns
    are harvested and dried to produce black, white, or green pepper, depending on
    the processing method.

    <b><i>When boiled in water, the liquid is consumed
    to treat digestive issues, respiratory conditions, and improve circulation,</i></b>
    as the pepper contains compounds that stimulate the digestive system and act
    as natural anti-inflammatories.'
